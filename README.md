# Learn2Flap
An Artificial Intelligence project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to master the game of Flappy Bird. Utilizing Reinforcement Learning techniques (Q-Learning), the CNN was trained solely on pixel data and reward feedback mechanisms to create a model that autonomously plays Flappy Bird with a high proficiency in gameplay.

# How to run:
Execute the main.py file and it will display how the model trained plays Flappy Bird.
